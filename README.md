# olx-scraper
Scraper for every OLX website (any country).
it stores all the data for a particular search query in a csv file in the working directory.

# installation
clone the repository, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the directory you've just cloned.

that's it, you did it!

# usage
simply execute the olxscrape.py script using `python olxscrape.py`.
it will ask you to choose a location and a query.

# note
be aware that a portion of OLX ad titles are not written in english. If you want to obtain results from that portion too, you will have to enter your query in the location's native language.

if you come across any error, don't hesitate to open an issue. I will try my best to fix it as soon as possible.
